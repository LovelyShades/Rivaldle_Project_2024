                        Rivaldle was conceived by two dedicated computer science students who share a deep passion for
                        both programming and the world of Marvel. As lifelong Marvel fans, we've spent countless hours
                        immersed in the Marvel Rivals universe, enjoying the thrilling challenges it provides. However,
                        as avid players, we noticed there was something missing—a trivia game that allowed us to
                        showcase our knowledge of the Marvel universe in a fun and engaging way. This realization
                        sparked the creation of Rivaldle. We envisioned it as a project where we could blend our
                        technical expertise with our love for Marvel, building something that could bring fans together
                        while challenging them to test their knowledge on characters, events, and stories that have
                        shaped the Marvel world over the decades.

                    <div class="popup_text" data-translate="aboutText2" id="aboutText2">
                        Our journey began as a simple idea to combine our passion for programming with our fandom, but
                        over time, Rivaldle evolved into something much more. We wanted to create a game that would be
                        accessible to everyone, from casual Marvel viewers to seasoned comic book enthusiasts. The
                        challenge was to design a game that maintained a balance between fun, accessibility, and
                        complexity. The idea behind Rivaldle was heavily influenced by the structure of Smashdle, a
                        trivia game centered around Super Smash Bros. Smashdle had a unique approach that appealed to
                        both casual players and hardcore fans, and we wanted to emulate that while giving it a Marvel
                        twist. The result is Rivaldle—a trivia game that feels fresh and exciting every time you play,
                        with a constant stream of new questions and challenges to keep players coming back.

                        Rivaldle isn’t just about answering questions—it's about immersing yourself in the Marvel
                        universe. With each round, you’ll find yourself revisiting iconic moments from movies, TV shows,
                        comics, and more. Whether you're answering questions about the Avengers, X-Men, or the vast
                        universe of Marvel villains, Rivaldle will take you on a nostalgic journey through the most
                        beloved parts of Marvel lore. Every question is designed to engage and challenge players,
                        helping them deepen their understanding of Marvel while having fun. And with our constant
                        updates, there’s always something new to explore and discover.

                        But Rivaldle is more than just a trivia game. We built it with the community in mind. As
                        developers, we believe that feedback is crucial to improving any project. That’s why we’re
                        always open to hearing from players, whether it's about a bug they encountered, a feature they’d
                        like to see, or simply thoughts on how to improve the user experience. Rivaldle was made by
                        fans, for fans, and it’s the support and input from players that will help it grow into
                        something truly special. We’re constantly looking for ways to evolve the game, add more
                        features, and refine the gameplay based on what you, the players, want to see.

                        works, including adding new game modes, enhancing the user interface, and even introducing new
                        types of trivia questions that will test players in exciting and unexpected ways. Our goal is to
                        make Rivaldle not only the best trivia game for Marvel fans, but a game that continually evolves
                        with its community. The Marvel universe is vast, and we want to ensure that Rivaldle reflects
                        its endless possibilities. As we continue to improve the game and grow the Rivaldle community,
                        we invite you to join us on this adventure. Your feedback, your passion, and your love for
                        Marvel are what make this project worthwhile.

                        Rivaldle is an engaging trivia game inspired by Marvel Rivals that allows you to challenge your
                        knowledge of the
                        Marvel universe. You’ll need to guess the correct Marvel character in four exciting and diverse
                        game modes:
                        Classic, Silhouette, Emoji, and Character Ability. Each mode presents different kinds of clues,
                        from
                        straightforward identification in Classic mode to creative challenges like deciphering
                        emoji-based hints or
                        guessing characters based on their unique abilities. This variety in gameplay ensures that each
                        round is fun and
                        offers something new, keeping the game fresh and exciting for both casual players and hardcore
                        Marvel fans
                        alike.

                        One of the key features of Rivaldle is that new characters are introduced daily, providing a
                        unique set of
                        challenges each time you play. Characters are randomly selected with no repeats, so every day
                        brings a fresh
                        experience. This means that no two gaming sessions are the same, and you’ll constantly be
                        challenged with new
                        trivia questions about characters from the Marvel universe. The random selection of characters
                        ensures there’s
                        always something new to discover, making the game enjoyable for everyone, from those who are new
                        to Marvel to
                        die-hard fans.

                        language for your
                        game experience. The third icon displays your current streak, so you can track how long you’ve
                        been answering
                        correctly and challenge yourself to improve your performance. The fourth icon is the 'How To
